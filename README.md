# CryptoCurrency
This project is based on Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper and implemented in Java. It was started for learning purpose to get some knowledge on block chain and cryptocurrency environment.
This is a full node. Block, BlockChain, Transaction - inputs and outputs, UTXO, Miner and Wallet were pushed on the first commit. But these are still in raw state and are not implemented in proper way.
Many changes are required and many features are needed to be implemented for example - difficulty is not implemented, proof of work is a hash with remainder 2 zeroes (this is done for simplicity) and 
cryptographic (public key, private key, digital signature) verification is implemented with RSA protocol but not with Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
