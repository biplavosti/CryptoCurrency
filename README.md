# CryptoCurrency
This project is based on Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper. It was started for learning purpose to get some knowledge on block chain and cryptocurrency environment.
Block, Block Chain, Transaction - inputs and outputs, UTXO, Miner and Wallet were pushed on the first commit. But these are still in raw state and are not implemented in proper bitcon way.
Many changes are required and many features are needed to be implemented for example - difficulty is not implemented, proof of work is a hash with remainder 5 zeroes (this is done for simplicity) and 
cryptographic (public key, private key, digital signature) verification are not implemented at all and etc.
I am now working on cryptographic portion.
